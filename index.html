            <p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the
                paragraph‚Äôs development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic
                sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph‚Äôs controlling idea.

                <p>
                    I started programing when I was around 14‚Äì15 years old. To be honest, I was reluctant to start
                    coding
                    and always thought it would require a lot of time and effort to learn. And all I wanted to do on my
                    PC
                    was to play games xD.
                    The credit of starting my programing passion goes to my brother who installed python (pycharm) for
                    me He sat with me and said ‚Äútype print(‚Äúhello‚Äù)!‚Äù which made the program write ‚Äúhello‚Äù on the screen
                    and
                    ohh boy I got totally hooked.
